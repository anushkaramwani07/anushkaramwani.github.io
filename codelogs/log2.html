      <h2> Difference between Absolute and Relative CSS length units.</h2>
    <h5> Absolute length units are fixed and don't change no matter what.
      <ul>Example:
        <li>px</li>
        <li>cm</li>
        <li>mm</li>
      </ul>
    </h5>

    <h5> Relative Units on the other hand  is flexible and it changes depending on the context.
      <ul>Example:
        <li>em: based on font size</li>
        <li>%: also based on font size</li>
        <li>vw</li>
      </ul>
