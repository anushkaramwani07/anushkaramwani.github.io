              Anni Albers (born Annelise Elsa Frieda Fleischmann) was born in Berlin, Germany, on June 12, 1899, and
              died
              in
              Orange, Connecticut, USA, on May 10, 1994.

              In 1949, Anni Albers became the first textile designer to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern
              Art
              in New York. Anni Albers was a textile artist born Annelise Elsa Frieda Fleischmann on June 12,1899, in
              Berlin, Germany.
              The school moved to Dessau in 1926, and a new focus on production rather than craft at the Bauhaus
              prompted
              Anni
              Albers to develop many functionally unique textiles combining properties of light reflection, sound
              absorption,
              durability, and minimized wrinkling and warping tendencies.
              Anni Albers, who was Jewish, made the move with her husband and the Bauhaus to Berlin, but then fled to
              North
              Carolina, where the couple was invited by Philip Johnson to teach at the experimental Black Mountain
              College,
              arriving stateside in November 1933.
